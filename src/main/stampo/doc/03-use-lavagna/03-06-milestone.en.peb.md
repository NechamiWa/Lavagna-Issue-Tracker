## Milestones

### Use milestones

Milestones are unique per project. Access milestones from the "Milestones" tab.

<img class="pure-img" src="{{relativeRootPath}}/images/en/milestone-panel.png" alt="Milestone">

#### Close a milestone

To close a milestone, click on the <span class="icon icon-milestone-open"></span> icon.

### Manage milestones

To manage labels, go to the [Project Settings](/03-use-lavagna/03-01-project.html#project-settings), and then the "Milestones" tab.

<img class="pure-img" src="{{relativeRootPath}}/images/en/milestones-manage.png" alt="Milestones">

Milestones can be reordered using the appropriate icons.

#### Create a new milestone

To create a new milestone, click the plus button, enter the name, and click create.

#### Edit a milestone

* <span class="icon icon-edit"></span>: edit milestone name
* <span class="icon icon-calendar"></span>: set due date
* <span class="icon icon-milestone-open"></span>: close a milestone
* <span class="icon icon-delete"></span>: delete a milestone

**NOTE**: a milestone that is still in use, meaning that it still has cards assigned, can't be deleted.
