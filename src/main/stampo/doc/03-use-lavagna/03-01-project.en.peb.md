### Edit Project

To edit a project, go to the [Project Settings](/03-use-lavagna/03-01-project.html#project-settings), and then the "Project" tab.

A project can be renamed in this section, and its description modified.

Changing the project short name is not possible after it has been created.

### Archive Project

A project can be archived/unarchived using the checkbox in this page.

This may hide the project in the home page if the "Show Archived Projects" switch isn't active.

### Delete Project

Lavagna doesn't support yet the full deletion of a project. It is recommended to archive a project instead.
