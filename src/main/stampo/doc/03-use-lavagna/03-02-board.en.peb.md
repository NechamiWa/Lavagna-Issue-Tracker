## Board

### Create Board

To create a new board, navigate to a project, and then press the plus button.

A dialog will appear. Enter a name, a unique short name, and a description, and press create.

### Archive Board

To archive, go to the [Project Settings](/03-use-lavagna/03-01-project.html#project-settings), and then the "Board" tab.

Then, press the archive icon on the board panel.

This may hide the board in the project home page if the "Show Archived Boards" switch isn't active.

### Delete Board

Lavagna doesn't support yet the full deletion of a boar. It is recommended to archive a board instead.
