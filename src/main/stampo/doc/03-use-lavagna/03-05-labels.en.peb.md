## Labels

Labels are a powerful way to create custom data to tag cards, providing both an easy visual feedback and a powerful search tool.

Labels are defined for each project. There are no global labels.

Each label has a type, with the following possibilities: 

* **Name only**: a simple label
* **Text**: a custom text can be set by the user
* **Date**: a date can be defined
* **Number**: a number can be specified
* **Card**: a card can be referenced (useful for a label like: "Duplicate of:")
* **User**: a user can be referenced (useful for a label like: "Review:")
* **List**: a value specified in a ordered list can be selected.

In addition, it can be specified if a label can be unique per card.

### Use labels

Labels are very powerful search criteria. [Learn more about search](/03-use-lavagna/03-07-search)

### Manage labels

To manage labels, go to the [Project Settings](/03-use-lavagna/03-01-project.html#project-settings), and then the "Labels" tab.

#### Create a label

Press the plus button to open the create label dialog.

Enter the name, color, and type, and press create.

For adding a new label, the following form must be used:

<img class="pure-img" src="{{relativeRootPath}}/images/en/labels-manage-create.png" alt="New label">

The name (unique in the context of a project), the type, the color and whether the label must be unique in card must be specified.

In case of a label of type **list**, the values must be specified later, see the the [Edit section](#edit-label).

#### Edit a label

To edit a label, click on the <span class="icon icon-edit"></span> icon.

A dialog will appear:

<img class="pure-img" src="{{relativeRootPath}}/images/en/labels-manage-edit.png" alt="Edit label">

**NOTE**: list values that are still in use can't be deleted.

#### Delete a label

To delete a label, click on the <span class="icon icon-delete"></span> icon.

**NOTE**: labels that are still in use can't be deleted.
